# ToDoList Made with Websockets

### Description

This is a simple exercise that demands to make a todolist shared in real time.

So, this todolist can be used by multiple users at the same time using sockets.io.

### Missions

- When a client connects, he retrieves the last known Todolist from the server.
- When a customer adds a task, it is immediately passed on to other customers.
- When a customer deletes a job, it is immediately deleted from other clients.

The server can hold the Todolist as a simple array that will be kept in memory.

2. Open your terminal to the project folder.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Then run `node app.js`.
5. Then open two or multiple navigators and browse to **http://localhost:8080/todo**.
